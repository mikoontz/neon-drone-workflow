USGS Metashape Workflow

1. Adding photos
- followed instructions exactly
- disabled calibration cameras

2. Align photos
Round 1 (unsuccessful)
- Accuracy: high
- Key point limit: 60000
- Tie point limit: 0
- Generic preselection: no
- Reference preselection: yes
- Reset current alignment: no
- Adaptive camera model fitting: yes

Round 2
- Accuracy: highest
- Key point limit: 60000
- Tie point limit: 0
- Generic preselection: yes
- Reference preselection: yes, Estimated
- Reset current alignment: no
- Apply masks to: None
- Guided image matching: no
- Adaptive camera model fitting: yes


3. Optimizing the photo alignment
Round 1
- Tools -> Optimize cameras
- Changed Camera accuracy (deg) from default (10) to 2
- Selected Fit f; Fit cx, cy; Fit k1; Fit k2; Fit k3; Fit p1; Fit p2
- No projections below 100, but all Error (pix) still above 0.3

Round 2
- Tools -> Optimize cameras
- Changed Camera accuracy (deg) from default (10) to 2
- Changed Tie point accuracy (pix) from 0.156 back to 1
- Selected Fit f; Fit cx, cy; Fit k1; Fit k2; Fit k3; Fit p1; Fit p2
- Selected 'Adaptive camera model fitting' which I think negates the selections above (?) in favor of picking the optimal settings
- Lowest projections is 2916, but all Error (pix) still above 0.3 (lowest is 0.327)

4. Error reduction - gradual selection
Round 1
- Model -> Gradual Selection (instead of Edit -> Gradual Selection)
4a. Reconstruction uncertainty (goal is to get to Level 10 or lower using 2 runs of this procedure; lower than Level 50 is 'highly recommended'; don't delete more than half the points on any single iteration)
- 1st iteration of Reconstruction uncertainty: Level 30 resulted in deletion of ~50% of the points
- Reoptimize (Tools -> Optimize cameras) using same settings as before: Fit f; Fit cx, cy; Fit k1; Fit k2; Fit k3; Fit p1; Fit p2
- 2nd iteration of Reconstruction uncertainty: Level 10 resulted in deletion of ~12.5% of points 
- (another) Reoptimize (Tools -> Optimize cameras) using same settings as before: Fit f; Fit cx, cy; Fit k1; Fit k2; Fit k3; Fit p1; Fit p2 (minimum projections is 742, and 5-10% of photos now with Error (pix) < 0.3)
4b. Projection accuracy (goal is to reach a level of 2 or 3; if not possible, go to a level of about 50% of the points selected; run until you reach projection accuracy of 2)
- 1st iteration of Projection accuracy: Level 2 resulted in deletion of 19% of points
- Reoptimize (Tools -> Optimize cameras) using same settings as before: Fit f; Fit cx, cy; Fit k1; Fit k2; Fit k3; Fit p1; Fit p2 (minimum projections is 412, and ~90% of photos now with Error (pix) < 0.3)

4c. Tie point accuracy value set to 0.1
- Reoptimize (Tools -> Optimize cameras) by checking ALL settings. SEUW: 1.55397 -> 1.55325))
- Tie point accuracy value set to 0.2
- Reoptimize (Tools -> Optimize cameras) by checking ALL settings. SEUW: 0.776634 -> 0.776634))
- Tie point accuracy value set to 0.156

-

Build

7. Build dense point cloud
Round 1
- Quality: Ultra high
- Depth filtering: aggressive
- Resulted in big gaps (diagnosis: too many points removed during the gradual selection step. steps to fix: rerun initial photo alignment and redo gradual selection procedure being more lenient with allowing some points to say in the sparse cloud; still hit the 'recommended' targets, but maybe not the 'best case recommended' targets.

Round 2
- Quality: Ultra high
- Depth filtering: aggressive
- Result looks much better than Round 1

8. Build mesh
- Source data: dense cloud
- Surface type: height field (because imagery is nadir facing, not oblique (?))
- Quality: high
- Interpolation: enabled
- Point classes: all
- Calculate vertex colors: check

9. Build texture
- Texture type: diffuse map
- Source data: images
- Mapping mode: adaptive orthophoto (USGS says orthophoto, but adaptive orthophoto is supposed to do better for vertical textures. Like trees?)
- Blending mode: mosaic
- Texture size/count: 4096
- Enable hole filling: checked
- Enable ghosting filter: checked
- Looks like this is going to be a long process; might be worth thinking harder about whether it's an output that we even need. USGS workflow suggests it can be used to reality check the orthomosaic process before building the full orthomosaic (about 15.5 hours; maybe orthophoto instead of adaptive orthophoto would be faster and sufficient?)

10. Build DEM
Projection: Geographic; EPSG4326
Source data: dense cloud

Total size (pix): 6820 x 6337

11. Build orthomosaic
Projection: Geographic; EPSG4326
