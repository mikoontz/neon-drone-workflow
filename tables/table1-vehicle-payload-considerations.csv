Vehicle,Rotocopter,Ease of takeoff and landing,Shorter flight time (~20 minutes),@anderson2013b; @goodbody2017; @padua2017
,,Hover capability,,
,,maneuverability,,
,,Affordable,,
,Fixed wing,Longer flight time (2+ hours),"Higher minimum flight speed to keep it aloft (affecting overlap, image quality)",
,,Covers large spatial extent,Complex takeoff/landing,
,,More stable in wind,,
,VTOL fixed wing hybrid,Simpler takeoff/landing,Newer technology,
,,Longer flight time,Expensive,
Payload,RGB camera,Small size,Limited spectral extent to visible wavelengths,@padua2017; @adao2017
,,Affordable,"Spectrally overlapping, imprecise spectral information",
,,Fine spatial resolution,,
,Multispectral sensor,Small size,Limited spectral sampling typically in visible and infrared wavelengths,
,,More precise spectral information,More complex data acquisition and post-processing,
,Hyperspectral/Imaging spectrometer,High spectral resolution,Heavy,
,,High spectral extent,Expensive,
,,,Very complex data acquisition and post-processing,
