## Abstract 

Macroecology research seeks to understand ecological phenomena with causes and consequences manifesting at spatial scales spanning several orders of magnitude.
Interactions between individual organisms just a few meters away from each other can be relevant for explaining regional biogeography across hundreds of kilometers, and vice versa. 
Broad-extent, fine-grain (i.e., high resolution) information is needed to adequately capture these cross-scale interactions and emergences, but these data are costly to acquire and process. 
Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS, or drones carrying a sensor payload) and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) make the broad-extent, fine-grain observational domain more accessible to researchers.
Integrating these tools can further democratize macroecological research by enabling researchers to flexibly and affordably fill spatiotemporal gaps in data collected by traditional means. 
However, using these tools for macroecology can be challenging, and mental models are lacking. 
Building mental models from scratch incurs costs of time, energy, and creativity which are likely better spent advancing science. 
This inspired a working group of drone-using academic ecologists, NEON professionals, imaging scientists, remote sensing specialists, and aeronautical engineers at the 2019 NEON Science Summit in Boulder, CO to create accessible recommendations and a sample workflow for ecologists new to drones and NEON. 
Specifically, we provide (1) a collection of best practices and practical considerations for collecting high-quality UAS data and (2) a sample workflow to process UAS data into meaningful ecological information and integrate it with NEON field and Airborne Observatory Platform data. 
With this mental model, we advance the democratization of macroecology by making a key observational domain-- broad-extent, fine-grain data-- more accessible via NEON/UAS integration.

## Introduction

Macroecology is the study of spatially extensive systems whose biological, geophysical, and social components interact dynamically both within and across spatiotemporal scales [@heffernan2014].
Macroecology, in its explicit consideration of scale, extends from a rich history of basic ecological research seeking to explain patterns in nature [@turner1989; @levin1992]. 
At the same time, macroecology is highly relevant to applied ecology, as the broader spatial extents studied reflect the scale at which many societally relevant challenges, and perhaps their solutions, arise [@heffernan2014; @larue2021]. 
The causes and consequences of phenomena under investigation in macroecology can span many spatial scales, which motivates a characteristic feature of the data to be brought to bear: they must often be simultaneously fine in grain (i.e., resolution) and broad in extent [@beck2012].

Ecologists typically face a data collection tradeoff between grain and extent that constrains the observational domain of their research [@ernest2018; @estes2018]. 
Indeed, the spatial and temporal observational domains of most ecology research is narrow [@estes2018]
The grain/extent tradeoff can sometimes be overcome, but at a high cost.
For example, the Global Airborne Observatory collects high spatial and spectral resolution data at broad extents [@asner2007; @asner2012], but the price of data acquisition and processing tallies in the millions of US dollars, even though the per-area cost is low [@asner2013].
As another example, the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program maintains a regular network of over 350,000 fine-grain field plots regularly spaced over the entire forested area of the United States (over 9.1 million km2; approximately 1 plot every 2400 hectares) at an annual cost of tens of millions of dollars [@gillespie1999; @alvarez2020].
Most science studies have relatively modest budgets and are conducted by just a few individuals [@heidorn2008].
The modal NSF Division of Environmental Biology award was about $200,000 USD between 2005 and 2010 [@hampton2013].
While the fine-grain, broad-extent observational domain is invaluable for macroecology, it can be inaccessible to ecologists with resource or funding limitations.

Increasing accessibility of relevant scales of observation reduces barriers to research participation-- it democratizes macroecology [@guston2004].
Removing these barriers improves science because the rate, direction, and quality of science are, in part, shaped by the available research inputs [@nagaraj2020].
For instance, access to the archive of Landsat earth observation imagery was improved in 1995, which dramatically increased the quantity, quality, and diversity of Landsat-enabled science [@nagaraj2020].
The same archive became freely available in 2008 with concomitant benefits to projects that rely on Landsat observations [e.g., @picotte2020].
The changing accessibility of Landsat is noteworthy for macroecology, as the archive provides global-extent, relatively fine-grain (30 meter) imagery since 1984.
Particularly when paired with the power of a planetary-scale geographic information system [such as Google Earth Engine; @gorelick2017], Landsat has led to breakthrough science that is “globally consistent and locally relevant” such as the first global map of forest cover changes over a decade-long period at a relatively fine scale [@hansen2013]. 

Accessible research stimulates revolutionary science.
In this way, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is revolutionary [@nsf2013; @balch2020].
NEON is a continental-scale observation facility in the United States comprising 81 sites within 20 ecoclimatically distinct domains and an operational lifespan on the order of decades [@schimel2013; @keller2008].
NEON is designed to collect rigorous, consistent, long-term, and open access data to better understand how U.S. ecosystems are changing, using a combination of field measurements by trained personnel, ground-based automated sensors, and the Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) which uses plane-based instruments to collect both active and passive remotely-sensed data [@kampe2010; @nsf2013].
NEON observations span spatial scales, from measurements of individual organisms within small field plots to 10 cm resolution RGB imagery and 1 m hyperspectral and lidar imagery across hundreds of square kilometers, with measurements replicated across  sites that span the  continental extent of the Observatory [@keller2008].
A stated goal of NEON is to democratize access to ecological research, particularly at broad extents [@nsf2013]-- its promise is continental-scale ecology for everyone.
NEON pairs publicly available data with a strong outreach and education effort to help realize this promise
In this way, NEON broadens access to macroecology by reducing barriers to entry, particularly cost, fieldwork requirements, and technical expertise (Nagy et al. 2021 in this special issue).
An “instrument” like NEON collecting standardized data at such scales leads to inevitable tradeoffs-- in the specific times, locations, and type of data that are sampled.
While the NEON data are on their own sufficient for advancing ecology, part of what makes NEON revolutionary is its foresight in facilitating connections to other ecological data.
In this way, the fundamental limitations of NEON can be overcome with bridges to more targeted ecological studies.

Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) can also revolutionize ecology [@anderson2013b].
UAS are increasingly being used to collect high spatial resolution information over relatively large spatial extents for ecological science applications [@wyngaard2019].
A UAS comprises a vehicle and a payload
The vehicle is also known as a “drone” or a “UAV” standing for  “uncrewed aerial vehicle”, “unhumanned aerial vehicle”, “unoccupied aerial vehicle”, or, more primitively, for “unmanned aerial vehicle”-- see @joyce2021.
The payload is what the vehicle carries beyond what is critical for flight operations, and gives the UAS its scientific value.
Importantly, it isn’t the drone itself that enables ecological studies at heretofore inaccessible scales, but rather the drone’s ability to position a data collecting payload (i.e., a sensor) in a repeatable, efficient, hard-to-reach manner.
For example, one use case for UAS is structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry which generates a 3-dimensional model of an area of interest using 2-dimensional images from multiple overlapping viewing angles [@westoby2012].
The minimum requirement for SfM photogrammetry is 2-dimensional imagery, which can be captured from the ground using a hand-held sensor (e.g., a digital camera) to great effect for some applications [@piermattei2019].
A drone-based camera can capture imagery from higher up in, or above, the canopy, which allows for measurement of higher vegetation strata [@kuzelka2018], including total height for above-canopy applications.
Drone-based SfM photogrammetry also increases the extent that can be covered with surveys [@jackson2020], since aerial transects are unimpeded by varied terrain and vegetation encountered on ground transects.
Unimpeded aerial transects are also more reliably repeated than ground surveys that require navigating through vegetation and are likely to be less impactful to that vegetation.
UAS provide an avenue to flexibly and affordably fill spatiotemporal gaps in data collected by traditional means-- they can be deployed more frequently and capture finer grain data than air- and spaceborne platforms, and can cover greater extents than ground surveys.
While UAS-derived data have the potential to revolutionize spatial ecology, a lack of standards and practical workflows for collecting and processing UAS data challenges the realization of this potential [@assmann2019; @wyngaard2019].

UAS and NEON complement each other.
Each can be a key tool for macroecology research, but their integration offers an opportunity to alleviate some of their fundamental constraints in a similar way as integration of NEON with other earth observing networks (SanClements et al. 2021 in this special issue).
Where NEON-collected data are rigid in space, time, and type, UAS data collection is nimble and customizable.
Where NEON is “state of the science”, UAS are relatively under-validated.
Where NEON data standards are thoroughly documented, UAS data standards are ad-hoc and idiosyncratic [@wyngaard2019].
Where NEON is continental in extent by virtue of its centralized governance, UAS-based projects lack a consistent, interoperable architecture.
Realization of the benefits of UAS-NEON integration by ecologists is challenged by the relative novelty of these tools and associated workflows (Nagy et al., 2021 in this special issue)
Not knowing where to start with not one, but two new tools is a daunting proposition and becoming proficient can create a “research debt” [@olah2017] of lost time that could otherwise be spent progressing science.

Mental models help novices become experienced practitioners by providing a contextual framework for new knowledge [@knapp2010].
e assembled a working group of participants at the 2019 NEON Science Summit in Boulder, Colorado with a goal to create accessible recommendations and a sample workflow for ecologists new to UAS to guide self-teaching and democratize the use of UAS to link with NEON as an ecology tool
ere, we outline some core principles relating to integrating drone-derived data with the NEON observatory
hroughout, we motivate the considerations within each principle with an example data collection mission including data and code
e emphasize that project-specific science requirements, rather than rigid prescriptions, should guide the decision-making regarding these core considerations for drone-enabled ecology and integration with NEON: vehicle, environment, regulations, mission planning, payload, calibration, georeferencing, data management, and data processing (including integration with NEON field and AOP data).

In this work, we aim to effectively lower the barrier to entry for using UAS and NEON to do ecology
pecifically, we focus on optical data collected by each tool over terrestrial sites and provide (1) a collection of practical considerations for collecting high-quality UAS data to integrate with NEON field and AOP data and (2) a real-world workflow depicting the processing of UAS data into meaningful ecological information at the NEON Niwot Ridge (NIWO) field site.

## Core considerations for NEON/drone integration

### Science requirements

Both NEON- and UAS-enabled ecology have faced criticism for having “backwards” approaches to science.
Critics suggest that clear science questions take a back seat to high-quality but rote data collection in the case of NEON [@lindenmayer2018] or perpetual methodological refinement in the case of UAS [@gillan2021].
In light of this, we echo @assmann2019 in emphasizing that the main question to keep in mind while navigating UAS-NEON integration considerations is: what are the science requirements?
Unfortunately, some of the UAS components (vehicle and payload) that are available off-the-shelf are not necessarily compatible with each other, which means that the decision for what system to use needs to take the considerations for both pieces into account at once.
Thus, the vehicle and payload likely need to be considered as the first step in building a UAS operation.

### Vehicle

The vehicle in a UAS, also known as the platform, is the flying machine that holds the payload.
One key distinction between vehicle types is whether rotor systems or fixed wings are used for lift (the upward force that keeps the vehicle in the air).
Rotocopter vehicles (also known as “multicopters”, “multirotors”, “quadcopters”, “hexacopters”, or “octocopters” depending on the number of rotor systems) consist of a body and 4-8 rotary systems that provide both lift and thrust (horizontal motion).
These types of vehicles are characterized as “vertical takeoff and landing” (VTOL).
Fixed wing aircraft use wings for lift, and use rotor systems only for thrust.
Hybrid vehicles use rotor systems for lift during ascent and descent, but fixed wings for lift during flight and are sometimes referred to as VTOL fixed wing systems to highlight this combination of features.
The structure and size of the vehicle determine its functionality in the field and thus a project’s objectives can often help constrain the choices available.
Rotocopter platforms are more maneuverable, often less expensive, easier to fly, more transportable, and have a higher payload capacity relative to fixed wing aircraft.
For these reasons, rotocopters are often preferred by ecologists.
On the other hand, fixed wing aircraft have longer flight times with better battery usage and thus can cover larger areas more efficiently than rotocopters.
For example, covering the full extent of a given AOP footprint (147.6 +/- 107.2  km2 for core and relocatable sites) may be most efficiently conducted with a fixed-wing or hybrid vehicle.
They are also more stable in adverse conditions (e.g., high winds) and have a safer recovery from motor power loss.
VTOL fixed wing systems can combine the efficiency of a fixed wing with the small takeoff/landing footprint of a rotocopter.

A flat surface clear of obstructions (e.g., on dirt rather than grass, away from canopy) is ideal for UAS take-offs and landings.
VTOL systems require a smaller take-off and landing footprint, which may be satisfied with only a small canopy gap, compared to vehicles that use fixed wings for lift, which require a “runway” for  fixed wing vehicles.
Locating such a site may be challenging at some NEON sites (e.g., NIWO, with dense canopy cover) and easy at others (e.g., SJER, with an open woodland ecotype).
Bringing something that can provide a clean surface will prevent dirt from obstructing or scratching the sensor lens; for example, a user may bring a car trunk’s mat or plywood as a reliable take-off and landing surface.
With any platform, the vehicle endurance and the mission goals are likely to require purchase of several batteries to keep the vehicle flying for the necessary duration of a field day.
A user may consider an energy source to charge batteries in the field, like a solar charger or generator, or may just invest in several batteries to have fully charged each day.

### Environment

The environment of your mission must be considered in flight planning and, in some cases, vehicle selection.
You must ensure that the vehicle and the sensor are capable of operations in the desired climate/region.
For example, high-wind conditions at NIWO may warrant a fixed wing platform; however, the dense forest would make take off and landing much easier with a rotocopter.
UAV flights at high elevations will drain battery faster than at sea level.
Heavy winds can push the UAV off-course and impact sensor readings on automated flights.
The ideal data collection conditions are evenly lit, with either complete cloud cover or clear skies.
If flying takes place under clear sky conditions, then the sun should be high in the sky so it doesn’t cast long shadows-- ideally within a couple of hours of solar noon (i.e., 10am and 2pm for standard time, and 11am to 3pm for regions that observe daylight savings time) [@assmann2019].
Managing the temperature of the mission critical electronics is just as important as that of the vehicle’s batteries during UAS operations.
The vehicle remote controller and any other peripherals such as a tablet computer are susceptible to extremely warm or cold temperatures drain battery life, and cold temperature can cause the vehicle and/or sensor to malfunction.
The mean annual temperature for NEON AOP sites ranges from -12°C at the Utqiaġvik site in Alaska to 25°C at Lajas Experimental Station in Puerto Rico (NEON Field Site Metadata; https://www.neonscience.org/sites/default/files/NEON_Field_Site_Metadata_20210226_0.csv; accessed 2021-03-16).

It may be prudent to take a picture of the sky and the weather forecast so that later reporting on flight conditions is more straightforward.
The NEON AOP does exactly this for their daily flight reports.
A handheld instrument for measuring temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed may also aid in the reporting of flight conditions, though note that the wind speed at flight altitude may be different than what is measured on the ground.
Our data collection took place under mostly sunny, light wind conditions on October 9th, 2019 starting at 2pm mountain daylight time.

### Flight planning

One of the key benefits of UAS operations is the ability to program missions to be automatically followed by the vehicle’s onboard flight software.
For optical data collection such as that required for structure from motion photogrammetry, the mission typically involves aerial transects with images captured at regular time or distance intervals (`r fig_nums(name = "fig-crosshatch", display = "cite")`) so that objects in a scene are imaged from many viewing angles (often in excess of 100; `r fig_nums(name = "fig-photo-overlap", display = "cite")`).
Successful flight planning requires consideration of the flight pattern, sensor angle, flight planning software, and operation routine.

Flight patterns are typically described in terms of their front overlap (a function of flight speed, flight altitude, frequency of image capture, and vertical field of view of the sensor) and side overlap (a function of flight altitude, horizontal field of view of the sensor, and distance between transects).
Higher overlap (in excess of 80% for both front and side overlap [@dandois2015] and even as high as 95% front overlap [@torres-sanchez2018; @frey2018] is required for successful photogrammetric reconstructions of more complex vegetation such as denser forests using commonly available photo processing software.
Lower overlap may be sufficient for 2-D mapping quality, though the processed product may not penetrate deeply into canopy gaps [@dandois2015] and image artifacts such as “leaning” objects which were only imaged from an oblique angle are more prevalent.
Additional overlap can be achieved by augmenting parallel transects with a second set of parallel transects rotated 90 degrees to the first (a cross hatch pattern; `r fig_nums(name = "fig-crosshatch", display = "cite")`).
Additional viewing angles can be achieved by tilting the sensor off nadir in order to capture oblique imagery which can aid in scene reconstruction [@james2014; @cunliffe2016].

Flight planning is typically achieved using specialized software, sometimes run on a separate device like a tablet computer.
Most flight software allows for setting the altitude as well as the desired forward and side overlap for a given aircraft and sensor.
Two other important software features that may routinely be relevant for ecology are terrain following and internet-free operations.
Terrain following enables the vehicle to ascend and descend to match topographic changes within the area of interest, such that approximately the same altitude above ground level is maintained throughout all aerial transects.
This serves two key functions: it ensures the safety of the vehicle and it maintains approximately the same ground sampling distance for imagery which aids in processing.
Some missions are most easily created once in the field in order to incorporate better information on the area of interest, takeoff/landing locations, and visibility throughout flight.
An ability for the software to function offline and to cache background map imagery can be critical for real-world UAS use.
Finally, flight software can be resource intensive enough to require higher computing power of the computer or tablet being used.
Crashing the flight software mid-flight due to compute resource overload is undesirable, so it is likely worth using a device with faster processors and/or more RAM.

A final consideration for successful flight planning is the routine used to execute missions.
Consistent repetition of routine steps prior to, during, and after a flight ensures that all components of the UAS work as intended in concert with each other, and checklists facilitate this consistency [@degani1993].
We highly recommend developing and using some kind of checklist for UAS operations such as the one we used for this manuscript (Supplementary Information)-- there is good reason they are part of standard operations for a range of aviators from pilots of small private aircraft to NEON AOP to NASA astronauts! Some applications (such as Kittyhawk; https://kittyhawk.io/) allow for automatic logging of checklist run throughs, which further reduces barriers to their use.
For our mission, we used Map Pilot for DJI by DronesMadeEasy, which enables full control of front/side overlap and camera angle, as well as allows for cross-hatch flight patterns, terrain following, and caching of data for use in the field when an internet connection isn’t available.

fig_nums(name = "fig-crosshatch", "Points depicting the UAS position for each photo captured during the flight. 
         The color of each point indicates whether the corresponding photo was retained for the data processing steps (black points) or not (red points).")

         Red points in the “X” formation at the center are the high-precision geolocations of the NEON vegetation plot monuments. 
         Each point needs to be imaged a large number of times (likely more than 100 for denser vegetation), which means that some areas with image capture at the edges of the flown area won’t have coverage suitable for structure from motion data processing. 
         Your flight area should therefore be larger than your area of interest to ensure sufficient data coverage.")
```

### Regulations (airspace and pilot)

UAS operators are responsible for understanding regulations on UAV flight for when, where, and what they want to fly based on the regulations under which they are operating.
This is an oft-cited hurdle to adoption of UAS for research use [@vincent2015].
There are currently three main sets of regulations for UAS operations within the United States: Part 107 for individuals, a Certificate of Authorization for organizations, and hobbyists who are flying strictly for recreational purposes.
The rules within each of these categories are actively changing, and UAV pilots are responsible for staying aware of these updates.
Special waivers are needed to fly in class D/C/B airspace near airports, to fly a UAV above 55 lb, and to fly a UAV beyond line-of-sight.
It is important to always call the appropriate land manager before flying on public land to obtain appropriate site access if necessary, to check for temporary closures (e.g., bird nesting), and to be a good neighbor.
Because NEON does not own the land on which they operate, flying NEON sites will require contacting and obtaining permission from the site host; contact information is available on the NEON webpage for each site, and NEON staff may also help facilitate those connections.
Additional, non-NEON research is allowed at some but not all sites.
If permission is obtained, it is important not to disturb any existing research being conducted at those sites, to maintain a 20m buffer around any NEON distributed plot, and to completely avoid the area of the tower airshed (which is also delineated on the NEON webpage for each site; e.g., https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data/spatial-data-maps).
Clear communication with concerned parties of UAV flights for research, even if you have every legal right to fly at a particular location, is important for building community credibility and longevity for drone ecologists.
The pilot should have an equipment list and an operations checklist to make sure safety procedures are followed.
Emergency operating procedures should be understood should a mishap occur, including: crash, battery fire, flyaway, airspace violation, or propellor injury.

### Payload

The payload is the equipment carried by the UAV that collects data for post-processing.
Most commonly, this includes a remote sensing sensor, and for some field ecologists, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna and receiver (see Section on Georeferencing below).
Integrating a sensor onto a vehicle may require specialized electrical engineering expertise, so purchasing an already-integrated vehicle and sensor or a pre-built integration kit is advisable.
Typically, the selection of a sensor represents a trade-off between spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and cost.
UAS with red-green-blue (RGB) or multispectral cameras can be affordably bought off-the-shelf.
The scientific questions will dictate the data requirements, which will in turn drive the payload decision.
What are the priorities - resolution (radiometric, spatial, spectral, temporal - RSST), spectral coincidence with NEON AOP flights, revisit time, etc.? For example, while hyperspectral data provide rich spectral detail that may allow you to identify the prevalence of specific chemical compounds in vegetation [e.g., foliar nitrogen; @knyazikhin2013], a multispectral instrument with fewer spectral channels [@koontz2021] or even an RGB camera [@scholl2020] may be more than sufficient for classifying vegetation to species.
The cost of the imaging spectrometer instrument itself as well as the post-processing time and data storage requirements are very high, so it is worth considering whether a multispectral or RGB camera would suffice for your particular scientific question.

We used a Micasense RedEdge3 sensor, which captures reflectance information in 5 distinct channels.
Using the quantum efficiency and filter bandpass sensitivity of an average RedEdge3 sensor provided by Micasense, we can estimate the relative spectral response of the instrument which characterizes how the sensor captures reflectance information across the electromagnetic spectrum (`r fig_nums(name = "fig-rededge-rsr", display = "cite")`).

```{r}

```

![`r fig_nums(name = "fig-rededge-rsr")`](../../figs/micasense-rededge3-relative-spectral-response.png)

### Radiometric Calibration and Corrections

NEON implements a complex algorithm to convert its imaging spectrometer data to units of reflectance [@karpowicz2015].
This compensates for the scattering and absorption of light as it travels through the atmosphere (e.g., haze, water vapor) on its optical path to the AOP.
As individual researchers collecting UAS imagery, we are responsible for converting our otherwise arbitrary image pixel values into meaningful, standardized units like reflectance.
Applying image preprocessing steps (e.g., correcting for camera artifacts such as vignetting and dark noise) and subsequent radiometric calibration allows our UAS data to be comparable with high-quality scientific data products derived from the NEON AOP.
The Empirical Line Method (ELM) has proved to be a simple and accurate UAS radiometric calibration option [@wang2015].
ELM requires the placement of at least two materials such as calibrated reflectance panels with known reflectance in the scene, which are used to map image pixel values to reflectance for each spectral band.
Many sensor vendors and photogrammetry software options only provide or enable a single panel for radiometric calibration.

To give your UAS image data the best possible chances of being calibrated using any method in the future, we recommend using 3 panels with varying gray levels.
Ideally, your panels should be large enough to be imaged during flight and contain an area of 10 x 10 pixels [@wang2015].
Panels should be matte (as opposed to shiny or glossy) with a smooth, horizontal surface [@smith1999].
Your panel colors should be shades of black (near 0% reflectance) and gray, ideally covering the range of reflectance for your subject of interest.
White (near 100% reflectance) panels are not recommended since they can saturate and cause other issues [@cao2019].
 For plant surveys, we recommend a medium grey, dark grey, and black target since vegetation tends to be about 50% average reflectance or medium gray.
You can purchase calibrated reflectance panels from vendors, or make your own.
Many studies have identified promising materials for homemade panels: plywood covered with matte paint [@rosas2020], gray linoleum, and black fine-weave cotton fabric [@cao2019].
However, care must be taken with homemade panels because even though they may appear a particular shade to the human eye (visible spectrum), they may not be a similar reflectance across all wavelengths observed by a multi-spectral or hyperspectral sensor.
 
Regardless of panel cost, color, or material, it is critical to clean, re-measure, re-calibrate, and/or replace them over time to ensure the most accurate reflectance calibration possible for your UAS imagery.
This is especially important when your field work involves exposing panels to harsh environmental conditions with dirt, dust, sand, sun, and any other types of physical damage or degradation.
To illustrate this point, we re-measured a calibrated reflectance panel after three years of field work using a handheld Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD, ASD Inc., a Malvern PANalytical Company, Longmont, Colorado) FieldSpec 4 spectrometer (USGS data release DOI available upon publication).
We present the vendor-provided panel reflectance from the time of purchase in 2017 with the averaged ASD handheld reflectance collected three years later in 2020 (`r fig_nums(name = "fig-calibration-panel", display = "cite")`).
The reflectance of the panel has decreased by as much as 10% due to the presence of dirt and dust.
This decrease in reflectance is especially noticeable in the shorter wavelengths.
If we use the vendor-provided panel reflectance data from 2017 for current and future flights, we will introduce significant error into our reflectance calibration.
According to the manufacturer, this make and model of calibration panel is not able to be cleaned (though newer panels from this manufacturer can be cleaned; see https://support.micasense.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005163934-Calibrated-Reflectance-Panel-Care-Instructions) as this will force debris further into the pores of the panel material, so it is important to use the updated reflectance measurement for this panel during radiometric calibration.

NEON in essence does this scene-based radiometric calibration too.
A series of vicarious calibration flights are conducted with the NEON AOP before and after every field season [@leisso2014].
They fly over two large tarps with 48% (medium gray) and 3% (black) reflectance, collect ground truth reflectance measurements of these tarps with an ASD, and use these data to verify the radiometric calibration of the NEON AOP Imaging Spectrometer (https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/imaging-spectrometer).
The reflectance of these tarps is meant to represent the upper and lower bounds of reflectance typically seen in nature.

We recognize that each researcher has vastly different constraints for their budget, environmental conditions in the field, and equipment availability, so “good enough” may be more realistically attainable than the “ideal” radiometric calibration practices described above.
Having one calibration panel is better than none; choose gray rather than white or black to avoid crushing or clipping in under/over exposed images.
Commercial SfM software like Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D accommodate at least one panel, so you can correct the imagery with a single panel although this may limit the data’s calibration possibilities using other methods.
If in-flight panel photos are not possible or if you have a small panel, be sure to take photos before/after flight.
A downwelling light sensor (DLS), also known as a sunshine sensor, records data about the current illumination levels during flight and is standard equipment on low cost multispectral sensors designed for agriculture.
The information collected by them is often incorporated into the SfM processing.
DLS data can help to correct each image based on changing light conditions during flight.

Use what you have.If you have a vendor-provided calibration panel(s) with reflectance measurements and a DLS, use them.
Keep the panel(s) clean and protected between uses.
If you have a tight budget, buy some materials from the hardware store and make your own.
Note that spectrometers like the ASD cost tens of thousands of dollars, so try to borrow a spectrometer from a group that you collaborate with or send your panel(s) to them to be measured.

```{r}
fig_nums(name = "fig-calibration-panel", "Comparison of reflectance spectra (A) for a calibrated reflectance panel (B).
The panel vendor provides a reflectance spectrum describing the panel’s reflectance at the time of purchase (black reflectance profile, “Micasense, 2017”).
After three years of using the panel repeatedly for field work, we re-measured the panel using a handheld spectrometer (blue reflectance profile, “ASD, 2020”) to evaluate the change in spectral reflectance for the panel.
The spectra in (A) are reflectance values as a function of wavelength across the visible and near infrared.
The MicaSense RedEdge 3 spectral band ranges (blue, green, red, red edge, near infrared) are illustrated here as vertical bars of color.
The panel reflectance decreased between measurements collected in 2017 and 2020, with this decrease being more pronounced towards the shorter wavelengths.
This is a result of the panel becoming dirty from dust and sand in the field, as seen on the plastic case for the panel (in the lower right corner of B).
This change in reflectance demonstrates the necessity to clean, re-measure, or replace your panels when performing radiometric calibration.")

### Georeferencing

It is important to consider how the geographic position of objects within your UAS survey are important for your research.
Do you need to know where those objects are on Earth in an absolute sense? Or is it sufficient to know the position of objects relative to each other? How precisely do you need to know the absolute positions of the objects? It is possible for the SfM photogrammetry process to reconstruct 3D models and orthomosaics of the area of interest using visual cues in individual images alone, without the need for any kind of geolocation data.
In order to incorporate units to these relative distances (e.g., to get the distance in meters), you need some measure of scale in your imagery.
In order to geolocate your SfM photogrammetry products in absolute space, you need external information about the geolocation of each input image, such as from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).
GNSS is the generic term for the network of satellites that offer global coverage of geo-spatial position, of which the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS) is a part.
If you have a GNSS antenna and receiver in your payload, then the data collected from your payload will be geo-tagged.
Many off-the-shelf payloads and vehicles contain a basic GNSS receiver with an accuracy of <10m.
If you do not have a GNSS receiver in your payload or if you require greater accuracy than what is provided by the built-in GNSS receiver, then additional steps are required.

Ground control points (GCPs), Real-time Kinematic (RTK) corrections, and Post-processed Kinematic (PPK) corrections are three solutions to accurately georeference images collected by the UAS.
GCPs are markers laid out on the ground with known geolocations that are visible in the UAS data and are used to tie your imagery to real-world coordinates.
Ideally, GCPs will be placed near edges or randomly throughout the mission area, but the density of GCPs is typically more important, with [@santana2021] finding that 10 GCPs in their 2 ha area of interest were needed for sub-7 cm precision (but 4 GCPs produced 16 cm precision at all flight heights and GCP spatial distributions).
@zimmerman2020 found that it was optimal to place GCPs in the corners of the study site, as well as at low and high elevations within the study site.
GCPs must be visible from the sensor, so it’s best to place them in bright and open areas.
Finding suitable locations in heavily forested areas with closed canopies can be challenging, therefore, it may be beneficial to expand survey areas to include suitable areas for GCPs if none can be found within the area of scientific interest.
Examples of effective GCPs are fabric swaths placed in an X, bright-colored bucket lids, or checkered mats (`r fig_nums(name = "fig-gcps", display = "cite")`).
NEON sites have permanent markers that have been georeferenced with high precision (approximately 0.3 m) that can be used as GCPs if they can be made visible from the UAS (`r fig_nums(name = "fig-photo-overlap", display = "cite")`).
High precision GNSS for geolocating the GCPs may be prohibitively expensive, but you may potentially borrow from geodetic services (e.g. nonprofit UNAVCO allows equipment to be borrowed for NSF-funded projects).  

RTK and PPK kinematic corrections augment the accuracy of the built-in GNSS receiver by correcting the noise inherent in the instrument using additional equipment and processing steps without the need for laying out GCPs and determining their locations.
For instance, @gillan2021 was able to survey and process data covering over 190 hectares of rangeland in approximately 30 days versus an estimated 141 days using a conventional UAS workflow, with an estimated 47 days saved just from using an RTK system versus GCPs.
Even with a high-precision GNSS (such as what is enabled with RTK and PPK corrections), it is still considered good practice by some to collect ground control points at known locations in order to quantify geolocation error.

```

### Data management

Data management can be broken into two phases: first, post-collection, while you’re processing the data and need easy access to them, and second, the long-term storage of the data and metadata.
It’s important to bring empty SD cards (with fast write speed, if possible) into the field to swap out of the UAV for frequent data transfer, as well as a laptop and an external hard drive(s) to transfer the data immediately, and back them up.
Have an idea of your anticipated data storage requirements for each mission to budget hardware accordingly (`r fig_nums(name = "fig-data-management-schematic", display = "cite")`).
Like with data processing, one must consider whether to store data locally or in the cloud, and how to backup the data.
For long-term storage, you will want to consider which data products from the mission to publish and how you’ll want to make these products publicly available.
We suggest publishing the raw images taken from UAS missions which may be processed to even higher quality products given the rapid advances in structure from motion photogrammetry.
You’ll also want to figure out good long-term storage for the raw data at your institution or elsewhere. 
For such high volumes of data, it is sound data management practice to establish "data levels" that characterize how derived each new processed product is, with Level 0 representing raw data and higher levels being derived from lower levels [@wyngaard2019].

For data collection, we recorded each flight’s imagery on a separate 32 GB SD card rated at >90 MB/s write speed.
For multi-day trips or if SD cards need to be reused, we transfer imagery from the SD cards to a portable solid state hard drive (Samsung T series).
 Upon returning from the field, we transferred images from the SD cards (or portable solid state hard drive, as the case may be) to two locations: 1) the solid state hard drive on a local desktop gaming computer for short term storage, and 2) a Network Attached Storage (NAS) with 6 spinning disk hard drives in a RAID array for long-term storage.
Both the short-term storage (local desktop) and long-term storage (NAS) solutions are backed up to the cloud using a 3rd party backup client (Backblaze) at a cost of ~$5.00 USD per terabyte per month.
We used the local desktop (Alienware Aurora R7 with an Intel i7-8700k 3.70 GHz hexacore processor and 64 GB of RAM) for data processing.
We use the same data levels as @koontz2021, except we didn't process our data to Level 3b or Level 4.
We used the Open Science Framework for public-facing storage (available upon publication).

```{r}
fig_nums(name = "fig-data-management-schematic", "Planning a data management pipeline is a hefty investment but can save time and money in the long-run, making it well-worth prioritizing up-front.
Considering the storage, backup, and sharing needs of the datasets you anticipate collecting and processing ensure data persistency and availability.
This data pipeline describes options and includes recommendations.
There are trade-offs at each decision point, so it is important to understand your data needs and budget.
For example, whereas building your own data management system may be more affordable and tailored to your needs, rented external storage systems will back up your data automatically and maintain the system and hardware requirements for you.")
```

![`r fig_nums(name = "fig-data-management-schematic")`](../../figs/data-management-schematic.png)

### Data processing

It’s recommended to perform quality assurance (QA) checks  on the images while you’re in the field, as a reality check before you leave and start processing (`r fig_nums(name = "fig-data-management-schematic", display = "cite")`).
This could mean viewing the images on a laptop on-site, or at the end of the field day at home, in an office, or in a hotel if it’s an overnight trip.
Check the data for obvious artifacts such as over or under exposure in images, that the number of images expected were collected, and that file sizes appear consistent and reasonable.
Generally a full QA assessment cannot be performed in the field due to time and computation limitations, but the field QA should be sufficient to ensure the images can be processed into desired products.
Some NEON sites (e.g., NIWO) have a field house that may be accessed, with permission, for laptop friendly workspaces and / or charging options.
Contact the site host at each site for more information.
Processing UAS imagery to create an orthomosaic or point cloud can be CPU, RAM, and GPU-intensive, so a workstation that balances these hardware components is ideal.
One may have a workstation powerful enough to process images locally, or they may want to invest in a cloud-processing option [e.g., Cyverse-- see @swetnam2018] (`r fig_nums(name = "fig-data-management-schematic", display = "cite")`).
Be sure to be consistent with the datum/projection for each of your datasets (GNSS positions of GCPs, GNSS locations of UAS camera), and transform where necessary.

Many software applications are available for structure from motion photogrammetry processing that produce results of similar quality [@forsmoo2019].
You must select the appropriate post-processing (i.e., photogrammetry) software license for you needs and resources (e.g., Agisoft Metashape, Pix4D), and take note of what processing steps you take from raw data to final products, for sake of reproducibility.

We followed the USGS workflow to process our raw Micasense RedEdge 3 imagery into an orthomosaic and a dense point cloud (https://uas.usgs.gov/nupo/pdf/USGSAgisoftPhotoScanWorkflow.pdf).
We classified the dense point cloud into "ground" and "non-ground" points using a cloth simulation filter algorithm [@zhang2016] implemented in the `lidR` [@roussel2019] package.
We used a local maximum filter to detect individual trees [@popescu2004] as implemented in the `lidR` package and a marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm to segment individual tree crowns [@plowright2018].
We used the `hsdar` package to spectrally resample the NEON imaging spectrometer data to match the spectral resolution of the Micasense RedEdge 3 camera [@lehnert2019].

```{r}
fig_nums(name = "fig-spectral-overlap", "Relative spectral responses for two channels of the Micasense RedEdge 3 camera plotted with the relative spectral responses for twenty channels of the NEON AOP imaging spectrometer.

## Discussion

Macroecology will benefit from a “macroscope” to enable the study of broad-extent phenomena across multiple scales of biological, geophysical, and social processes [@beck2012; @lawton1996; @dornelas2019]. 
The ideal macroscope comprises a nested array of tools that provide full coverage of spatial and temporal observational domains. 
In their complementarity, the value of multiple observational tools in concert is more than the sum of the parts [@dornelas2019]. 
Pairing UAS with NEON partially completes the constellation of Earth observing tools that contribute to the macroscope, and combines the flexiblity of UAS 
In this work, we aid the adoption of these tools amongst macroecologists by providing a mental model and some practical considerations for their integration.

Challenges remain for integrating UAS with NEON, but they are surmountable.
Some of these challenges are fundamentally associated with "big", cross-scale data.
Integrating data cross scales brings a host of potential pitfalls that could pollute inference if care isn't taken to avoid them [@zipkin2021].
Clear documentation of data provenance including sensor characteristics, data acquisition methods (e.g., flight pattern), data acquisition conditions (e.g., time of day, cloud cover) will enable rigorous cross-scale data integration.
The proliferation of reasonably low-cost, off-the-shelf, drone-ready sensors (many designed for precision agriculture use) creates a need for validation of whether those instruments produce "science grade" data (which itself is a relative term, depending on what the specific science requirements are for a given project).
This validation may be achieved via direct comparison of the low-cost sensors with “state of the science” instruments using coincident flights [e.g., @fawcett2020].
Big data in ecology is relatively new [@farley2018], and approaches to UAS-derived big data are fairly ad hoc across researchers [@wyngaard2019].
Maintaining supportive communities of practice, such as the High Latitude Drone Ecology Network (https://arcticdrones.org/), can help overcome some of these idiosyncratic approaches.
Integrating UAS operations with NEON can help anchor the community to the common currency of NEON data types, organization, and collection protocols which will enhance the interoperability of UAS data.
Cyberinfrastructure for managing and processing UAS data are not yet built in a way that encourages consistency between projects or researchers.
In this way, NEON provides an aspirational example for how purpose-built cyberinfrastructure can facilitate macroecology, and the foundational resources for building an equivalently valuable architecture for UAS data may already be represented in other NSF-sponsored projects (e.g., Cyverse, OpenTopography, Open Science Framework). 
NEON alos provides an aspirational target for educational resources, which are critical to ensuring that would-be NEON/UAS users have the environmental data science skills necessary to turn their data into inference [@hampton2017].
Critically, increasing access to an elusive observational domain (broad-extent, fine-grain) doesn’t equate to it being fully accessible. 
We can illustrate this point using access to the Landsat archive, which we previously discussed as an exemplar of the effect of data access on democratization of science. 
While making Landsat images cheaper brought more researchers from lower prestige institutions and lower income parts of the world [@nagaraj2020], but they are still overwhelmingly men [@miller2016; @miller2016a].
A truly accessible tool wouldn't exhibit such a demographic bias, and it is incumbent upon the UAS and NEON community to be self-reflective about who is being excluded from the community and proactive about what steps can be taken to make it more inclusive.

We conclude with a research agenda for UAS/NEON integration, which we hope provides a vision to be built upon. Integrating UAS with NEON allows:

1. Filling in spatial and temporal scales missed by NEON data collection (e.g., capturing data in a year when a NEON site is skipped by the AOP, collecting data on a similar vegetation type of a NEON site but outside of NEON's direct footprint, capturing data at a site multiple times per year to understand phenomena at sub-yearly time scales, tracking individual plants through time, capturing data at spatial resolutions finer than 10 cm)
1. Opportunistic data collection (e.g., capturing data immediately after a disturbance event)
1. Connecting NEON data to other Earth observing systems using UAS data as a bridge
1. Supplementing NEON data using sensors that aren't part of the NEON suite of sensors (e.g., thermal data to compare thermal regulation of different plant species) 
1. Validating lower cost, off-the-shelf payloads against the state-of-the-science NEON data collection (e.g., determining how well a multispectral imager designed for agriculture captures surface reflectance, determining how well an algorithm detects the trees in a NEON vegetation structure plot)
1. Replacing high-cost NEON AOP flights with lower-cost alternatives (e.g., if the drone-derived data are "good enough" compared to the AOP, can we reduce the operational costs of the AOP)
1. Using NEON data as a common currency for validating new methods
